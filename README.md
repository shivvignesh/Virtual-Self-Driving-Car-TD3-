# Virtual-Self-Driving-Car-TD3-

### This repo contains TD3 algorithm implementation on MUJOCO environment. 

### The TD3 algorithm is also implemented for a virtual self driving car on a kivy environment.

## Note : 
### There can be substantial amount of improvements which can be added to the code to the make the movement of the car more precise and accurate. As of now, the input to the TD3 network is a patch of map/image surrounding the car. I aim to add the orientation of the car with respect to the goal state as-well in the hope of making it more precise, along with changes in envirnoment variables.
